Start with Snowball Calculator
Showcase new additions added to our dashboard (Try new Calculation, previous calculations, view last calculation)
For snowball calculator, go to previous calculations, and edit first calculation
Once the calculation is completed, go back to https://www.schwabmoneywise.com/snowball-debt-elimination-calculator, and show the margin of error for the snowball calc
There should only be around a 0.1% chance of error between our calculator and the schwabmoney calculator
Next showcase 401K calculator through the dashboard, and again edit the first calculation done
After the calculation is complete compare our calculation with the https://www.adp.com/resources/tools/calculators/states/illinois-salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx
Our calculation should once again be around 2-4% margin of error and explain how we got these numbers
Lastly showcase the budget calculator, and try a new calculation
Explain how we now have a way to implement snowball and 401k calculations into the budget calculation, and give the percentages that are calculated based on other calculators
Fin.
