    <h4 class="mb-3">Snowball Debt Calculator</h4>
    <p>The Snowball Calculator empowers you to take control of your debt by offering three evidence-based strategies for repayment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snowball Method:</strong> Focuses on paying off your smallest debts first to build momentum. Once a debt is cleared, you roll its payment into the next smallest one—like a snowball gaining size—helping you stay motivated as you witness quick wins.</li>
      <li><strong>Avalanche Method:</strong> Prioritizes paying debts with the highest interest rates first. While this may not give you the psychological boost of quick wins, it is the most cost-effective strategy in the long run by minimizing total interest paid.</li>
      <li><strong>Fewest Payments First:</strong> Targets debts with the fewest remaining payments, helping you quickly eliminate accounts and reduce mental load, while freeing up cash flow earlier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can pair this calculator with our Budgeting Tool to see how much extra money you can allocate monthly toward debt without compromising essentials.</p>

    <h4 class="mb-3">401(k) Retirement Calculator</h4>
    <p>This calculator estimates the size of your retirement nest egg based on real-world financial inputs. It accounts for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial 401(k) balance or first-time deposit</li>
      <li>Your annual salary and expected salary growth over time</li>
      <li>Employee contributions as a percentage of income and employer matching policies</li>
      <li>Compound annual return rate based on typical investment performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also visually charts your progress over the years, showing how your savings can grow exponentially thanks to compounding. Use this to assess whether you're on track to retire comfortably and when you may reach your financial independence goals.</p>
